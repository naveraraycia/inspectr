### Password Strength Checker

It determines whether the inputted password contains a lowercase letter, uppercase letter, digit, and a special character. It also checks for the number of characters and requires a minimum of 8 characters for it to be considered and accepted as a strong password.

### HTML Tag Remover
In this portion of the website, the HTML Tag Remover checks the user input for HTML tags. Upon the submission of the input, it removes all the opening and closing HTML tags it detects.
